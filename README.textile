h2. WHY?

Pretender is a library to help to integrate java systems with rest services who return json responses.
You don't have to write a concrete class ( duplication, argh! ) just to hold some value, which in most cases is what you' ll do.
Or worse, you would ship your domain classes to the client.

For example, lets suppose a service which returns a person object serialized as json:

<pre>
<code>
{"age":"5","name":"andre","buddies":{"maria":{"name":"maria","age":12}}}
</code>
</pre>


You just write a simple interface like:

<pre>
<code>
interface Person{
   String name();
   Integer age();
   List<Person> buddies;
}
</code>
</pre>

And pretender will generate an implementation for the Person interface, returning the values deserialized from the json.
If your method is named "name". it will return the "name" field and so on.

If you want to use another name, just annotate you method with

<pre>
<code>
@BindToName("my new property name")
</code>
</pre>

h2. INSTALLATION

<pre>
<code>git clone git://github.com/andrerigon/pretender.git
cd pretender
mvn install</code>
</pre>

h2. USAGE

Pretender comes in two flavours: 

lazy:

<pre>
<code>
Pretender.gsonLazyDeserializerFor(Person.class, Client.class, ....);
</code>
</pre>

and eager bean deserializer:

<pre>
<code>
Pretender.gsonEagerDeserializerFor(Person.class, Client.class, ....);
</code>
</pre>

each one will return a Gson instance configured to use pretender's type adapter
